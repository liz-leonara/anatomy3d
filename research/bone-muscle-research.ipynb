    "We will begin with a simpler model, where the top bone is named bone $A$, the bottom bone is named bone $B$, and bone $A$ is tilted away from bone $B$ at an angle $\\theta$. Suppose the muscle connects to muscle $B$ at the point $\\vec{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ and muscle $A$ at the point $\\vec{r}_N = (x_N, y_N)$ (the meaning of these variable names will be apparent later). Now, let us define the variables $s_B^* := | \\vec{r}_0 | = \\sqrt{x_0^2 +Â y_0^2}$ and $s_A^* := | \\vec{r}_N | = \\sqrt{x_N^2 + y_N^2}$, where $s$ is a parameter for the arc length of the bone and the asterisk indicates they are critical points for our problem."

Let us further define $(x_n, y_n)$ as the point where muscle $n$ connects to muscle $n + 1$ or, in the case $n = N$, to bone A. Futhermore, let us also define the coordinates $(l_n, \\phi_n)$ where $l_n$ is the length of muscle segment $n$ and $\\phi_n$ is its counterclockwise angle relative to the $y$-axis."

This length is also the sum of the signed projections of each muscle segment onto the straight line connecting these two points. This will be important for finding the gravitational potential of the bones later."
